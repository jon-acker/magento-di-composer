# magentoce-test Setup

Please follow the below steps to get started, if you encounter any issues installing the dependencies or provisioning the vm please check the [Common Issues](#common-issues) section first.

## Clone the project

Clone the project into your local file system:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:inviqa/magentoce-test
```

## Install Dependencies

1. Ensure you are using a ruby managed by rbenv / RVM as system rubies can cause issues. Currently [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) is the recommended version manager.

2. Install the latest version of Vagrant from [http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

3. Install/Update hobo:

    ```bash
    gem install hobo-inviqa
    ```

4. Ensure you have AWS keys correctly configured either using `hobo config` or by setting the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables.

## Provision Environment

You can now build the development environment for the first time. In the project directory, execute the following command:

    $ hobo vm up

You should now be able to access the site at [http://magentoce-test.dev](http://magentoce-test.dev)

## Hobo Usage

With the hobo enabled environment up and running please make use of the following commands for day to day usage.

```bash
hobo vm start  # Starts the vm without the overhead of provisioning
hobo vm stop   # Graceful halt of the vm
hobo vm ssh    # Start an SSH session on the VM
hobo vm mysql  # Connect to the database on the VM
```

## Common Issues

As setup issues are encountered please detail with step by step fix instructions, and where possible update the project itself to provide a more permanent fix.

 - **I do not have a ruby version manager**
   [rbenv-installer](https://github.com/fesplugas/rbenv-installer) will install rbenv for you.

 - **'Unknown command: hobo' even after installing hobo-inviqa**
   Assuming you use rbenv please run the command
   ```bash
   rbenv rehash  # Enables newly installed gem commands
   ```

 - **Installing the 'vagrant-berkshelf' plugin fails with 'minitar conflict'**
   This is a conflict between berkshelf and librarian-chef, to fix this issue please do the following
   ```bash
   # OSX Users
   /Applications/Vagrant/embedded/bin/gem install minitar --install-dir ~/.vagrant.d/gems
   Overwrite the executable? [yN]  y

   # Linux Users
   /opt/vagrant/embedded/bin/gem install minitar --install-dir ~/.vagrant.d/gems
   Overwrite the executable? [yN]  y

   # Windows Users
   C:\HashiCorp\Vagrant\embedded\bin\gem install minitar --install-dir "%HOME%\.vagrant.d\gems"
   Overwrite the executable? [yN]  y
   ```

   If you have customized the install path of vagrant you will need to adjust the path appropriately.

 - **Ruby stacktrace mentioning 'hostsupdater' during 'hobo vm up'**
   Please remove any magentoce-test.dev entries from your hosts file and retry
